# CyberSecurityConcepts

I spent a couple hours the summer of 2021 reading through Glassdoor.com to see what users submitted for security questions they'd received while interviewing for security engineer jobs. I wrote down all of them that weren't duplicates and that's what you've got: raw job interview questions. These are apparently the same questions asked by Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Salesforce, LinkedIn, etc.

I purposefully didn't map the question to a company. That's not the point of this repo. Learning is.

Security is difficult to get your arms around, much less your brain. I sorted the questions into logical topic groups, though. I'm also answering the questions periodically at https://theprojectx.co.

And please, send me changes/additions/etc.
